I am Hannah Bricker and this is the final version of my final project.
I did not have the time to get a peer to review my work unfortunately.
I started out modeling my project after a non-profit's webpage and then
gradually morphed it into what it's become now. It's not much but I worked
day and night for a full week to finish this project and I'm really proud 
of what I was able to accomplish with this. I've learned a lot and, because
of my current job role, I'm able to apply what I learned immediately. 
This project was pretty cool.
